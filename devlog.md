I will need to research the project requirements and plan out my process for implementation.

I believe it would make most sense to start out with a simple program to take prefix notation and compute the expression. Future steps in error checking, argument parsing, and history recording can be done later.

Since the argument parsing for batch mode already exists, I can simply include in the beginning with an if statement. The if statement can select betwewen running a function for batch mode or interactive. I can work on a function for batch mode first. I will need to figure out how to parse arguments and compute given pre-fix notation expressinos

Successfully implemented batch mode with error checking. Will continue testing for additional errors. Will beegin work on implementing interactive mode.

Need to think about how to implement history within my recursive loop.
